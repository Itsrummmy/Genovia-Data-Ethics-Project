<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
## Project Overview
This project was focused on creating a comprehensive ethical framework for the use of AI in the fictional nation of Genovia. Genovia's rapid technological advancement, especially in AI, had led to its widespread adoption across various sectors. However, this rapid growth also raised significant public concerns about data privacy, potential misuse of AI technologies, and their broader societal impact. To address these concerns, the Genovian government launched a competition, and our team of five took on the challenge of developing a Hippocratic oath and charter for ethical data use.


<!-- Deliverables -->
## Deliverables
Our core deliverable was a two-slide presentation: one outlining a Hippocratic oath for AI practitioners in Genovia, and the other detailing a comprehensive charter for ethical data governance. In developing these, we focused on several key ethical considerations, including addressing bias in algorithms, ensuring robust data security, promoting transparency in AI decision-making, establishing clear lines of accountability, and upholding fundamental human rights, fairness, non-maleficence, and beneficence. We then presented our proposed oath and charter in a formal setting, which included presentations to a panel of judges, followed by a Q&A session. We also engaged in panel discussions with the other student groups participating in the competition.



<!-- Outcomes -->
## Outcomes
Our proposed oath and charter was selected as the winning submission. The judges specifically commended our holistic approach to addressing such a wide range of ethical considerations, particularly how we tackled the complex issue of algorithmic bias and ensured transparency. The formal presentations, panel discussions and Q&A were invaluable, as we received critical feedback and had to defend our approaches to complex ethical dilemmas. It was a rigorous but rewarding process.


<!-- Conclusion -->
## Conclusion
This project really solidified my understanding of the crucial intersection between technology and ethics. It taught me the importance of considering diverse perspectives when developing ethical guidelines, especially in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. It also significantly improved my communication and collaboration skills within a team setting.
