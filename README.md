<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
## Project Overview
At Digital Futures, I had the opportunity to contribute to a project focused on developing an AI ethics framework for the fictional nation of Genovia. Genovia was experiencing rapid technological advancement, particularly in AI, with widespread adoption across various sectors. This rapid growth, however, raised serious public concerns regarding data privacy, potential misuse of AI, and its broader societal impact. Recognizing the need for clear ethical guidelines, the Genovian government launched a competition, and our team of five took on the challenge of creating a Hippocratic oath and charter for ethical data use.


<!-- Deliverables -->
## Deliverables
Our core deliverable was a two-slide presentation: one outlining a Hippocratic oath for AI practitioners in Genovia, and the other detailing a comprehensive charter for ethical data governance. In developing these, we focused on several key ethical considerations, including addressing bias in algorithms, ensuring robust data security, promoting transparency in AI decision-making, establishing clear lines of accountability, and upholding fundamental human rights, fairness, non-maleficence, and beneficence. We then presented our proposed oath and charter in a formal setting, which included presentations to a panel of judges, followed by a Q&A session. We also engaged in panel discussions with the other student groups participating in the competition.



<!-- Outcomes -->
## Outcomes
Our proposed oath and charter was selected as the winning submission. The judges specifically commended our holistic approach to addressing such a wide range of ethical considerations, particularly how we tackled the complex issue of algorithmic bias and ensured transparency. The formal presentations, panel discussions and Q&A were invaluable, as we received critical feedback and had to defend our approaches to complex ethical dilemmas. It was a rigorous but rewarding process.


<!-- Conclusion -->
## Conclusion
This project really solidified my understanding of the crucial intersection between technology and ethics. It taught me the importance of considering diverse perspectives when developing ethical guidelines, especially in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. It also significantly improved my communication and collaboration skills within a team setting.
